To add a compliant device, create a folder with the model name in this 
directory with the following directory heirarchy:

.
|
|--MODELNAME
   |--drivers
   |  |--open.{py, h}
   |  |--{open.c, any other supporting files}
   |  |--read.{py, h}
   |  |--{read.c, any other supporting files}
   |  |--close.{py, h}
   |  |--{close.c, any other supporting files}
   |--usbinfo

-------------------------------------
For the below functions:	
    - in the event the operation fails, return a null pointer, which is 
    - device_handle refers to whatever context the drivers of the device uses 
      to handle the hardware

open contains the following function:
device_handle *open_device()

read contains the following function:
float read_device(device_handle *dh)

closeModule contains the following function:
int close_device(device_handle *dh)

---------------------------------------
usbinfo.py must contain:
idVendor=[device vendor ID]
idProduct=[device product ID]
